# B.F.G. ("Boson-Freon Gizmo")

 A Lua-based mod for the game **Teardown** by Tuxedo Studios.
 
 "Plasma weapon that blasts large holes in most materials."
 
 Parts of the code and one sound effect are taken from the [Laser Gun](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2399638522) official mod by Tuxedo Studios.
 Additional sound effect is from Doom 2016, by id Software.
 Model is by me.
 The mod can be found on the Teardown Steam Workshop at the following [link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415401573).
